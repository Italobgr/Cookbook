Project: Recipe Web API with Advanced Integrations and Clean Architecture
This project consists of developing a .NET Web API for managing culinary recipes, focusing on best development practices, scalability, code quality, and integration with modern tools. The solution was built for practical learning and to strengthen advanced backend development skills.

 Google OAuth Authentication
A secure and modern login system was implemented using Google OAuth 2.0, allowing users to log in with their Google accounts, providing a seamless and secure authentication experience.

‚òÅ Deployment on Azure
The API is deployed and maintained on Microsoft Azure, simulating a real production environment. This includes environment setup, resource management, and deployment using Azure App Services, ensuring reliability and scalability.

 ChatGPT Integration
The API integrates with ChatGPT, enabling dynamic text generation such as recipe descriptions or automated culinary suggestions, adding value through artificial intelligence.

 CI/CD Pipelines
The build, test, and deployment processes are automated using CI/CD pipelines, ensuring continuous, secure deliveries with minimal manual intervention. Tools like GitHub Actions (or Azure DevOps, if used) were implemented.

 Unit & Integration Testing
To ensure the reliability of business rules, unit tests and integration tests were implemented, validating isolated functionalities as well as component interactions.

 Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
The project follows Domain-Driven Design principles to clearly separate responsibilities across Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation layers, promoting maintainability and scalability.

 SOLID Principles
The system was built applying the SOLID principles, encouraging cohesion, low coupling, and ease of extension with minimal impact on existing features.

 Sonar Cloud Integration
Sonar Cloud was configured for continuous code analysis, identifying code smells, vulnerabilities, and improvement opportunities, ensuring a cleaner and higher-quality codebase.
